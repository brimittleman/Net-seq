This is the workflowr site for my Net-seq project. I will have all of the data, code, and analysis here.  


Set-up for mappping my libraries:  
* [Setting up conda environment](conda.environment.html)  
* [Setting up config and snake files](config.snake.setup.html)  


Initials data exploration:  
* [Initial data exploration for NetSeq1 libary](initial.data.exploration.html)  
* [Explore read lengths that are mapping](map_stats_from_bam.html)  
* [Explore the UMI usage in the NetSeq1 library](explore_umi_usage.html)  
* [Use the genomation package to vizualize genome features and see overlap with Net-seq1](visualize_genomefeatures.html)  
* [Look at the reads in different gene regions](explore_umi_usage.html)  
* [Exploration of read counts per gene](reads_in_genes.html)
